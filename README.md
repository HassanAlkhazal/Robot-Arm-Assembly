# Robot-Arm-Assembly
The assembly of this robot arm is done by Solidworks software. The steps has taken to assemble the robot are as follow:
1. I have imported the base and waist files. 
2. The parts has installed by using "mate" command. It is the only command has used for all parts.
3. The rest parts has assembled by using the same steps in 1 and 2.
4. The file has saved as STL format.

Note: the assembled parts are not precise due to the inaccurate design of them and the missing parts. The assembly is just to clarify the robot final shape.

The analysis of the assembly is as follows: 
 I. The base will contain a motor to have the rotation in 360 degree. 
 II. The waist will be placed over the base, and its function to hold the motor that will move the first arm. 
 III. The second arm has special and brilliant design, which it makes the arm to be capable for holding two motors. One of the motors for the arm its self and the other for the       end effector.
 IV. The end effector design contains a place for a motor that gives the end effector an extra movement.
